# Comparison of performances of different architectures
(TITLE UNDER REPO IS INCORRECT THIS IS A PNEUMONIA DETECTION PROJECT)
Pneumonia detection using Resnet50, alexnet, MobileNet, Nasnetmobile models.
ResNet50 model is the best at predictions out of all the others
Alexnet, MobileNet and NasNet have overfitting issues as a result of which they show very high accuracy but ahve very poor predictions
