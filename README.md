# Comparison of performances of different architectures
Breast Cancer detection using Resnet50, alexnet, MobileNet, Nasnetmobile models.
ResNet50 model is the best at predictions out of all the others
Alexnet, MobileNet and NasNEt ahve overfitting issues as a result of which they show very high accuracy but ahve very poor predictions
